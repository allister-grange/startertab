I was getting sick of the same old new tab page. I wanted to have a dashboard for everything I reach for in my typical workday, so I built it. 

StarterTab is here to revolutionize the way you start your day on the internet. With a completely customizable webapp to replace your new tab homepage, you can personalize your online experience like never before.

You can install the [chrome extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia?hl=en), or the [firefox extension here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/startertab-your-next-new-tab/) and make StarterTab the site that opens up on every one of your new tabs.

## Tech

Local storage is being used for storing all of your customizations, meaning you own your data! All of the settings, tokens and themes sit on your own browser. Some may call it laziness that I don't want to maintain a database, you could also see it as me helping prevent your data being in yet another cloud service.

Written in NextJS with ChakraUI. The frontend and functions are hosted on Vercel, the database on Neon.

yarn install
```

### 2. Configure your local environment

Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Add details for all providers you want to use:

```

DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=<YOUR_SECRET_HERE>
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=<true or false>
```

### 3. Start the application

To run your startertab locally, use:

```
yarn dev
```

To run it in production mode, use:

```
yarn build && yarn start
```

## Creating a New Tile

1. Create your new Tile component in the `src/components/tiles` folder. Make sure to accept a 'tileId' prop, this enables you to change the color of the text based off the settings changed in the sidebar.

```js
type PageProps = {
  tileId: number;
};

export const YourNewTile: React.FC<PageProps> = ({ tileId }) => {
    const color = `var(--text-color-${tileId})`;

  return ();
}
```

2. Add your tile type to the TileType in `src/types/settings.ts`.
3. Add your new tile into the corresponding sizes you want available for your tile in the switch statement for `tileSize` in `src/components/sidebar/OptionsForTileTypeSelect.tsx`
4. Add your tile type to the switch statement for the `tileType` in `src/components/TileContainer.tsx`

**if you need persistent storage**

1. Add your new value into the `TileSettings` type within `src/types/settings.ts`
2. Create a new selector in recoil for your new setting value in `src/recoil/UserSettingsSelectors.tsx`
3. Use that selector within your tile

selector example:

```ts
export const imageFilePathSelector = createTilePropertySelector<string>(
  "imageFilePath",
  (theme, newValue) => {
    theme.imageFilePath = newValue;
  }
);
```

using that selector in a tile:

```ts
  const [fileValue, setFileValue] = useRecoilState(
    imageFilePathSelector (tileId)
  ) as [string | undefined, SetterOrUpdater<string | undefined>];
```

**creating a sidebar menu item for options**

1. Add your new option to the `OptionType` in `src/types/settings.ts`
2. Add your option into the sizes that pertain to it in `src/helpers/sideBarOptions.ts` 
3. Edit the `src/components/sidebar/SettingOptionContainer.tsx` to include the new option type
